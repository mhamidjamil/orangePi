# Serial Interface Web App

This is a simple web application that allows you to view and interact with serial data from a device connected to your Orange Pi 5 Plus.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python, Flask, and PySerial installed.

   ```bash
   pip install flask pyserial
   ```

2. **Run the App:**
   Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:6677` or `http://localhost:6677`. Replace the address with the IP of your Orange Pi for network access.

3. **Usage:**

   - The web page displays real-time serial data from the connected device.
   - Use the input field to send data back to the device.

4. **Customization:**
   - Modify the Python script (`app.py`) to adjust the serial port or customize the interface.
   - Update the HTML template (`templates/index.html`) to change the look and feel.
